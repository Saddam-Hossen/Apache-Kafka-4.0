Excellent and practical question:
**“Why should I work on the same error data 3 times?”**

Let’s break it down — this is about **Kafka reliability, not waste.**

---

### 🔄 Why Kafka retries the same message:

Kafka’s retry mechanism exists because **many errors are *temporary***, not permanent.

#### ✅ Common *temporary* errors:

* Database was momentarily unavailable
* Timeout from an external API
* Temporary network issues
* Threading/resource contention
* A resource needed by your listener wasn’t ready yet

In these cases, retrying the *same message* after a short delay gives your system time to recover. Often, the retry **succeeds**, and you **don’t lose data**.

---

### ❌ But if it's a *bad message* (e.g., malformed JSON)?

Yes — then retrying 3 times **won’t help**. That’s why **after max retries**, it gets sent to a **Dead Letter Topic (DLT)**. This avoids retrying endlessly.

You can then:

* Analyze bad messages later
* Fix and reprocess them manually or automatically

### ⚙️ So what are your options?

| Option                        | Description                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Keep retry (default)**      | Good for temporary failures, recoverable issues |
| **Lower retries to 1**        | If you expect only permanent failures           |
| **Add smarter checks**        | e.g., don't retry for known fatal errors        |
| **Use custom `ErrorHandler`** | Skip retry for specific exception types         |

---

### 🔧 Example: Skip retry for bad data

You can configure the `DefaultErrorHandler` to **not retry** for specific exceptions:

```java
DefaultErrorHandler handler = new DefaultErrorHandler(recoverer, backOff);
handler.addNotRetryableExceptions(MyBadDataException.class);
```

Now, if your code throws `MyBadDataException`, Kafka will **not retry**, and the message goes straight to the DLT.

---

### ✅ Conclusion

You work on the same error data 3 times **only because the system assumes it might succeed later**. But you’re always in control:

* Tune retry count
* Customize error types to skip retry
* Use DLT for permanent failures
